Permissions Issues: If the default temporary directory 
(/var/lib/nginx/body or similar) is not accessible to the 
Nginx process(e.g., if the directory doesn't exist or if there are incorrect permissions), 
Nginx may fail to process requests that require temporary file storage. This can result in errors like:

502 Bad Gateway (directory not exist permission issues) 
or 
413 Request Entity Too Large errors (This error can occur when Nginx receives a request body 
that's larger than the maximum allowed size (as defined by the client_max_body_size directive)).

===========

- check permission in case of we define directive  
- does upload need to be inside root directory 
- case of upload with server only no location block exist
